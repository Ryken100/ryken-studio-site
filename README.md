# Ryken Studio site

You probably don't need these directions unless you are very few people, but here they are regardless

## Setting up a dev environment
Make sure that you have NodeJS and a Code editor (Such as VS Code) installed, as well as some kind of version control.

## Installing tools
After cloning the repo, open the directory in a terminal and run `npm i`

## Developing
 - `npm run build` to build the project from `/src/` to `/public/`
 - `npm run watch` to keep building as you make changes
 - `npm run serve` to spin up a quick web server that also builds the project as you make changes

 If you get confused by the code, there are comments everywhere. 
 
 If you for some reason, you REALLY can't figure something out, contact the dev of this site [here](https://twitter.com/Arlodottxt) or [here](mailto:arlo.godfrey@outlook.com)
